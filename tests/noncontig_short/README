This test is taken form the ANL test suite and is based on their noncontig.c code.

reg_test.py is the main script. It takes no options so just run it. It will create
reg_test.sh using write commands and using experiment_management.  Then, reg_test.py 
will use experiment_management to submit reg_test.sh. It will do this by passing 
input_script.py to experimenet_management.
