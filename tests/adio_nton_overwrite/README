This test will use fs_test to create an N-N strided files using posix and a
a fuse mount point.  The initial files (4MB) are overwritten with 2MB files.
The last overwrite creates 5MB files

Files:
- reg_test.py: entry point for the test. Creates reg_test.sh which will be
  the actual program that will be run to do the steps in this test.
- input.py: experiment_management input file to generate the mpi
  command that will write out the fs_test target (non-plfs).
- test_common.py: file containing shared variables and functions for use in
  creating a consistent submittal of reg_test.sh.
- input_script.py: experiment_management input file that will be used to run
  reg_test.sh, the generated script.

The test proceeds as follows:
- reg_test.py creates reg_test.sh
- reg_test.py calls experiment_management with input_write.py as input. The
  output is put into reg_test.sh.
- reg_test.sh implemets for loops for mount_points, write_size (4M, 2M, 5M), and io type (posix, fuse)
- reg_test.sh verifies file sizes after each iteration.
