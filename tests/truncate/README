This test is intended to verify that the trucation of a file in plfs is 
successful.  The sequence of operations is as follows:

1)  PLFS is mounted via FUSE as defined in user's .plfsrc
2)  A file is opened and the letter "a" is written across the entire file
3)  The write operation is verified by reading the pattern written in 2.
4)  The file is truncated in half.
5)  The data pattern is verified with a read of the file
6)  1/10 of the file is written with the letter "b".  The write is centered
    in the middle of the file.
7)  The data pattern is verified with a read of the file
8)  The file is truncated in half.
9)  The data pattern is verified with a read of the file
10) The file is removed
11) PLFS is unmounted

If the truncation and data verification is successful, the test result is
"PASSED", otherwise a "FAILED" test.
