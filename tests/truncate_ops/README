This test will perform various trunc offset operations on a file created 
by this test. It will work on a shared_file (N-1) mountpoint.

Files:
- reg_test.py: entry point for the test.  It runs the bash script trunc.bash
- truncate.c: C program that performs truncate operations on a file created
  by the program.  
- trunc.bash: Script that compiles truncate.c and runs truncate (compiled 
  truncate.c).
- check_results.py: Looks at output logs and determines if the test has
  passed or failed

The test proceeds as follows:
- reg_test.py Sets up environment and calls trunc.bash
  target.
- trunc.bash determines if shared_file mount point exists. If a shared_file
  mount point does exist, c executable truncate is called. 
- truncate performs various truncate tests on a file created.
