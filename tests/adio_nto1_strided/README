A simple N-1 strided write and read test through a MPI-IO

Files:
- reg_test.py: Main test script
- input.py: input script for experiment_management to create a command to read
  and write to a target.
- intput_test.py: input script for experiment_management to run the generated
  reg_test.sh script.
- test_common.py: python file with common variables and functions to ensure a
  consistent set of parameters between input.py, reg_test.py, and input_test.py.

Flow of the test:
- reg_test.py creates reg_test.sh. Calls upon helper scripts in the regression
  environment to put in lines into reg_test.sh to ensure a consistent
  environment.
- reg_test.py calls experiment_management with input.py as input. The output
  is put in reg_test.sh
- reg_test.py calls experiment_management with input_test.py as input. This
  submits reg_test.sh as a job.
