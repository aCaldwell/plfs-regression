This test is designed to test two directory operations:

1) rmdir on a non-empty directory
2) making sure that a mkdir on the mount point creates the directory on all
   backends

For rmdir on the non-empty directory, /etc/passwd is copied into a new
directory on the mount point, and then the test attempts to remove the
directory by using rmdir. This removal should fail. The test verifies that the
copy of passwd in the directory still matches /etc/passwd. The directory is
then removed using 'rm -rf'.

The mkdir test creates a new directory within the plfs mount point and then
loops over the backends for that mount point to make sure the directory is
present.

Files:
- reg_test.py: It sets up the output directory and calls mkdir_ops.tcsh
  redirecting the output from mkdir_ops.tcsh to an output file.
- mkdir_ops.tcsh: the main test script. It carries out both tests outlined
  above.
- check_results.py: the script used to check the results of the test.
