This test is used to verify plfsrc functionalilty.  It produces various
plfsrc files then determines if plfs_check_config reports the correct
information based on the plfsrc file produced.  
Directory creation based on plfsrc mount and backend specifications is
also tested e.g. if a backend directory is specified that does exist,
the test verifies the directory is indeed created.

Files:
- reg_test.py:  Sets up the output directory and calls test_plfsrc.bash file 
- test_plfsrc.bash: Copies and manipulates various plfsrc files.  Runs
  various tests to make sure plfs_check_config reports plfsrc directives
  correctly
- check_results.py: checks the newest log file to see if the test passed
