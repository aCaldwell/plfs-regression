This test is to make sure PLFS handles truncating an open file correctly. This
is done by using echo and output redirection statements like the following:

echo "aaa" > foo
echo "a" > foo

If there is an issue with truncate on an open file, then foo will have extra
garbage in it instead of just a single "a". The file size as reported by ls -l
will also not reflect the size of a single character.

This test does not submit a job. It runs the entire test on the node that
reg_test.py is executed from.

Files:
- reg_test.py: handles mounting plfs, determining files and calling
  truncate_open_file.bash
- truncate_open_file.bash: Performs the echo and output redirection on two
  files passed to it from reg_test.py, making sure they are the same after
  the operations
- check_results.py: checks the newest log file to see if the test passed
