This test will make sure there is no data-integrity problem when data-sieving
is turned on. PLFS doesn't work with data-sieving, and there are settings in
the adio layer that should turn this off. Therefore, even when a user tries to
turn on data-sieving, it should stay off and there should be no data integrity
problem.


Files:
- reg_test.py: Main test script. Generates reg_test.sh.
- intput_test.py: input script for experiment_management to run the generated
  reg_test.sh script.
- common.py: python file with common variables and functions to ensure a
  consistent set of parameters.


 Flow of the test:
- reg_test.py compiles fileview-with-ds-switch.c.
- reg_test.py creates reg_test.sh. Calls upon helper scripts in the regression
  environment to put in lines into reg_test.sh that get a proper environment
  and mount through fuse.
- reg_test.py calls experiment_management with input_test.py as input. This
  submits reg_test.sh as a job. It will submit the job such that it runs with
  either one or two processors per node.

How the test works
Fileview-with-ds-switch.c has to be run with exactly 4 processors. The reason
for this is that the smallest number of equal m by m sized chunks a n by n
matrix can be divided up in to is 4. The test uses a 10 by 10 array and each
rank gets a 5 by 5 subarray to write to. Each process writes to the same file
their portion of the array. With data-sieving turned on, it seems that some
portions of the file are over-written by procs that shouldn't have written
to that portion.
