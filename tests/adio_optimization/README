ADIO optimization is done by passing hints to mpi. This test checks to make
sure hints are being passed all the way through mpi. This is done by passing
--hints to fs_test. Fs_test, when run, will set the hints in mpi and will then
go back and make sure those hints are actually set.

reg_test.py is the main script. It takes no options so just run it. It will
create reg_test.sh using write commands and using experiment_management.
input.py is the input file used by experiment_management to generate the
commands that are put in reg_test.sh. Then, reg_test.py will use
experiment_management to submit reg_test.sh. It will do this by passing
input_script.py to experimenet_management.
test_common.py contains common variables and functions to ensure a
consistent set of parameters between input.py, reg_test.py, and input_test.py.
