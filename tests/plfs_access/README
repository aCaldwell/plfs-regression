This test is used to verify that plfs_access returns the correct values
based on a plfs mount point plus sub directories.

Files:
- reg_test.py Handles top level management of the test including calling
              access.bash       
- access.c  C source code that gets compiled with plfs libs.  It calls
            plfs_access
- access.bash Script that compiles access.c and and executes access binary
              that in turn calls plfs_access
- check_results.py Determines if the test has passed or failed
