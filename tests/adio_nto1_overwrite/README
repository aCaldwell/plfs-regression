This test will use fs_test to create an N-1 strided files using plfs via  
adio.  The initial file (4MB) is overwritten with a 2MB file.
The last overwrite creates a 5MB files

Files:
- reg_test.py: entry point for the test. Creates reg_test.sh which will be
  the actual program that will be run to do the steps in this test.
- input.py: experiment_management input file to generate the mpi
  command that will write out the fs_test target.
- test_common.py: file containing shared variables and functions for use in
  creating a consistent submittal of reg_test.sh.
- input_script.py: experiment_management input file that will be used to run
  reg_test.sh, the generated script.

The test proceeds as follows:
- reg_test.py creates reg_test.sh
- reg_test.py calls experiment_management with input_write.py as input. The
  output is put into reg_test.sh.
- reg_test.sh implemets for loops for mount_points and write_size (4M, 2M, 5M).
- reg_test.sh verifies file size after each iteration.
